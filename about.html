    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
      Navigating a huge campus like the University of Maryland can be stressful. This website is designed to help locate specific buildings to relieve stress and allow people to get to their final destination as easily as possible. Other filters can also be applied to find a list of buildings that satisfy the selected category and its location on the map.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Use It</h3>
    <p>
      The Home page consists of an input box, filter button, random button, refresh button, and several radio buttons to be used when filtering a list of UMD buildings. If a specific building is desired or the user wants to filter from the localStorage, simply just type in the input box the desired building name or keyword and the filtered list will pop up right away. If a random list of 15 buildings is wanted, press the random button. Filtering from this random list is also possible by selecting a radio button option or typing in the input box followed by pressing the filter button. The website will only filter from the random list if it has been pressed. If the user wants to filter from the API and localStorage, please make sure to not press the random first or press the refresh button to start over prior to typing an input value or selecting a radio button option. Another feature is when the user clicks on the markers on the map, they are labeled corresponding to its building name. Lastly, another feature of the website is that when clicking on the UMD logo at the top of the page, it will direct the user to the UMD home page.

    <h3>What is being displayed?</h3>
    <p>
      After the data has been filtered, the map will have markers of where the building is and there are pop up labels on each marker when clicking on it. The right side of the page is displaying the list of corresponding building names based on the filter whether that is filtering the localStorage or the random list.
