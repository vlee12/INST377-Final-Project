Title: UMD Building Map

Project Goal: This website is trying to display a list of UMD buildings corresponding to the selected filter or inputted filter. These buildings are then marked on the map with a labeled marker of the building name. This website was created in the hopes of helping students and visitors navigate their way around campus and find out what buildings are present here on campus. This website gives the user a chance to look a list of buildings in a certain category like residence halls and/or find the location of a specific building by inputting the building name in the input field. 

Target Browsers: The website is designed to be displayed on all target browsers whether that is Windows, Safari, iOS, Android, etc. however, it is most efficiently displayed on laptop/desktop browsers and iOS. All iOS phones are compatible no matter the version. For example, an iPhone XR and iPhone SE both display the website the same and as expected. 

API: I used the UMD Map API specifically the one that has the list of buildings on campus. The link to the API: https://api.umd.io/v1/map/buildings

Visualization: The visualization being displayed on the website is a map. I used leaflet.js external library to implement the map onto the website. There were no other external libraries used for the other features of the website. The map displays the building locations corresponding to the filtered list. 

CSS: I used the Flexible Box/Flexbox layout mode, more specifically the latest version of CSS which is the CSS 3 web layout model to style the website.
